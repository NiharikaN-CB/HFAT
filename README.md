🎯 Overview
HFAT (Hybrid-Fast Adversarial Training) is a novel framework that achieves robust neural networks against adversarial attacks while maintaining:

⚡ 10-20x faster training compared to traditional PGD-based adversarial training
🎯 High clean accuracy through knowledge distillation
🛡️ Strong robustness against white-box attacks (PGD-20, AutoAttack)
🔬 Proven methodology preventing catastrophic overfitting
